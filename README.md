# Credit_Score_Classification
A credit score is a numerical summary of a consumer’s apparent creditworthiness. It’s calculated taking into consideration the consumer’s payment history, salary, amount owed, and other financial information.
In this case, we need to develop a model that could predict consumer’s apparent creditworthiness. We have access to a 100000 rows data set. The data set also has 27 descriptors and a multiclass label (Poor, Standard and Good) to identify creditworthiness.

The tools used for this projects are : Python, Tableau, and Python libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, seaborn.
Analysis was dividied into two steps. First, the data was cleaned, and analized before storing it as a clean csv file. 
Finally, in the final step, the predictive models were developed and evaluated following the shown diagram.
